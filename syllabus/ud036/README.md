# [Introduction to Python Programming](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud336)

## About

In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of the Python programming language, along with programming best practices. You’ll learn to represent and store data using Python data types and variables, and use conditionals and loops to control the flow of your programs. You’ll harness the power of complex data structures like lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples to store collections of related data. You’ll define and document your own custom functions, write scripts, and handle errors. Lastly, you’ll learn to find and use modules in the Python Standard Library and other third-party libraries.

## Lessons

### [1. Why Python Programming](#syllabus)

  - Receive an overview of what you’ll be learning and doing in the course
  - Understand why you should learn programming with Python

### [2. Data Types and Operators](#syllabus)

  - Represent data using Python's data types: integers, floats, booleans, strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, compound data structures
  - Perform computations and create logical statements using Python’s operators: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, Membership, Identity
  - Practice whitespace and style guidelines

### [3. Control Flow](#syllabus)

  - Write conditional expressions using if statements and boolean expressions to add decision making to your Python programs
  - Use for and while loops along with useful built-in functions to iterate over and manipulate lists, sets, and dictionaries
  - Condense for loops to create lists efficiently with list comprehensions

### [4. Functions](#syllabus)

  - Define your own custom functions
  - Create and reference variables using the appropriate scope
  - Use iterators and generators to create streams of data

### [5. Scripting](#syllabus)

  - Install Python 3 and set up your programming environment
  - Experiment in the terminal using a Python Interpreter
